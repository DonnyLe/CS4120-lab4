    "Summary\n",
    "----\n",
    "This lab will guide you through the setup and uses of pretrained models in `Tensorflow` and `transformers`. In this lab we focus on BERT (https://github.com/google-research/bert/) an __encoder only transformer model__. We will use the pretrained model to extract features from text and use these features to train a classifier to classify different types of data. We will setup a binary classifier on the IMDB dataset. You will be working on training new models on the other datasets."

The [CLS] token is used to capture the overall representation of the input sequence for classification tasks, while the [SEP] token is used to indicate sentence boundaries and separate different segments of text, enabling BERT to understand relationships between sentences. These tokens play a vital role in enabling BERT to handle a wide range of natural language processing tasks effectively."
